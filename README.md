# Advent of Code 2022

This repository holds my *dirty, but not so quick*, solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code programming puzzles") 2022 puzzles.  
Maintained mostly by PyCharm 2022.3 
Current Desktop: ubuntu:GNOMEnk | 2021.2.1

Some of the puzzles were quicker to solve with some other tools.  

Dropped off the sledge on day 12, Hill Climbing.
Naively took a recursive approach to start with, without realizing actual input would lead to
performance issues. Worked fine for the test case, though.  
Tried optimizing it for several days, unsuccesfully.  

Took an iterative backwards approach instead. But did it in Android/Kotlin in order
to carry on familiarizing with it. No need for any rush any more.  
Will work in that environment for the rest of the solutions.  
Will publish those in another repository.
