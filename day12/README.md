# Advent of Code 2022 Day 12 Hill Climbing Algorithm

# Puzzle1
Testcase solved by day12puzz1.py  

However, recursive approach was too heavy for the actual input.  
Dropped off the sledge at this point trying to optimize it.
Had to take an iterative approach backwards instead.  
Switched to Android/Kotlin environment at this point in order to familiarize  
myself on it and as no need for quicker solutions any more.  
Will make those solutions available in another repository.
